# Learning materials for unit test course for BioSKN.

## Prerequisities
- python 3
- pip 3

## How to start?
1. Download and extract the repository. There is green button above file list for ZIP download. Or you can just clone it if you use git.
2. Open console in repository root directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. To see how the tests work, just enter `pytest`.  

Voila! You just ran your first unit tests. Now you can learn how to use them by yourself. First go through the `quickstart` code and tests to see the structure of the tests. Then you can check out the exercises.

I would recommend to start with the Monte Carlo exercise, as the functions and their tests are already suggested so that it will be easier to write them.
